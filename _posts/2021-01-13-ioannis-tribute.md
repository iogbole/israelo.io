Farewell my friend, Ioannis<br/>
Sorry, you had to close the chapter this soon. <br/>
I am happy for the opportunity to have mentored you,<br/>
Though I wonder to what end, now that you are gone.<br/>
So glad I was, when we finally got the chance to work on the same account.<br/>
The lunch we shared,<br/>
The protein bar chat,<br/>
The home gym chat, <br/>
Your crazy Masters degree idea still gives me a chuckle.<br/>
The life you left behind in Greece...<br/>
We are from different parts of the globe,<br/>
We are of different races,<br/>
Yet, we had a lot in common. <br/>
Immigrants from our home countries, <br/>
With similar challenges, yet not giving excuses, <br/>
Working hard to make a better life for our loved ones.<br/>
I love you so much, my brother, <br/>
My brother from a different mother.<br/>
Oh,  how I will miss you.<br/>
If only, if only, if only I knew...<br/>
I laid in bed, in the dark and kept thinking loud to myself,<br/>
If only, if only, if only I knew...<br/>
I felt the blow of your demise the hardest when all was dark,<br/>
In the quiet of the night, whilst I reminisced, wondering...<br/>
If only, if only I knew <br/>
That our 1:1 call on the 11 Dec 2020 was the last one.<br/>
You spoke about your recovery from COVID,<br/>
and I told you about my family's recovery from COVID, too<br/>
But COVID came back for you, this time, not to spare. <br/>
Your friendship was a blessing,<br/>
And I will miss you so.<br/>
You took your last breath<br/>
To end your suffering,<br/>
If I said it hadn't affected me,<br/>
I'd just be bluffing.<br/>
If I could change everything,<br/>
You know I would.<br/>
The <a href="https://www.israelo.io/blog/terrform/" target="_blank">Terraform plan</a> for 2021 I shared with you in our last 1:1,  <br/>
I got it done. I passed it. <br/>
But it was a day too late. A few hours too late.<br/>
I did what you would have wanted <br/>
By posting the news on LinkedIn, <br/>
Except you weren't there to cheer me on. <br/>
Since the loss of you, <br/>
I've learned to live for each day <br/>
And take it as a blessing,<br/>
Knowing how frail life is. <br/>
Jobs, cars, houses, certifications... <br/>
Will all fade into the dark shadows of the deep.<br/>
What really matters is what you did, <br/>
always smiling and going the extra mile to make a difference.<br/>
Oh, How I will miss you, my brother.<br/>
I am thankful for the moment we shared <br/>
I am thankful for the passion we shared.<br/>
I am thankful for all you shared with me. <br/>
I am thankful for the blessing you were to many people. <br/>
Your memory will live on; my colleague turned friend <br/>
Goodbye? No, I won't say that. <br/>
Goodnight? Perhaps so. <br/>
Good night, for now, Ionnais <br/>
Καληνυχτα, Ionnais Christoudis <br/>
Please catch a good spot for me in the presence of the Lord. <br/>
Rest On. <br/> 
Till we meet again. <br/>
