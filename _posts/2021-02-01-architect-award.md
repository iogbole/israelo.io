I will keep this blog post short as it's meant only for journaling.

Personally, I don't have a lot of great memories in 2020 due to the way COVID-19 battered my family. Thankfully, we all survived. 

But then, on the 1st of Feb, 2021, I was recognised with a beautiful AppDynamics Architect of the Year Award.

It means a lot to me, and I will cherish the trophy for a long time - something positive from 2020!
