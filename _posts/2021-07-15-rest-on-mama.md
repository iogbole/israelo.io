description: "R.I.P Mama, though this dark brown grave-sand of yours only adds colours to my tears"

The chill that runs down my spine, the fatigue, the pain...<br>
My heart literally aches, and I just can't explain it. <br>
I thought I could handle it; nothing could be farther from the truth.<br>

My only consolation is in your last words. You were happy and at peace! <br>
I know you're in a better place — free from cancer pain — no more morphine. <br>

The things you've been through.<br>
You've endured suffering and pain.<br>
No matter what I feel, there's no way I'd want you to go through that again. <br>
You can rest in peace now, Mama. <br>
<strong>Death seems to be kinder than life.</strong> Quite an irony, eh? 

The heavens have decided, it was time to go yonder.<br>
Yonder place where the stars are shining so bright! 

Knowing that I can never get a hug from you again is the reason my pillows are soaking wet at dawn.
Oh, how I miss you, Mama. 

I collected your grave-sand and brought it all the way to the UK.<br> 
I clench your grave-sand so hard, hoping it might bring us closer. <br>
<strong>But this dark brown grave-sand of yours only add colour to my tears</strong>, Mama. 

I'd wrap your blanket on me, but it doesn't stop the cold, this chill that runs down my spine; who can help me now? <br>

Oh Lord, You've drilled a hole in my heart, and only You can mend it.

Until we meet again, never to be separated again. <br>
Please catch a good spot next to your mansion for me. <br>
Rest on, Mama. <br>

Much love,<br>
Your last-born X<br>
