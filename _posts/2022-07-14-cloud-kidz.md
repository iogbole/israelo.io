description: "Watch my kids as they demystify the concepts of cloud computing, cyber security, cyberbullying, etc. I am a proud #GirlDad..."

I am a proud #GirlDad. We try to expose our girls to activities they enjoy, such as cooking, ballet, gymnastics, and so on, in the hope that they will eventually discover what they want to do with their lives when they are adults.

However, I am slightly biased - I teach them coding and computing - with the hope they fall in love with IT. I described my approach in the <a href="https://www.israelo.io/blog/kids-who-code/" target="_blank">Tips To Get Your Kids Excited About Coding</a> blog post. Check it out! 

It's incredible how fast they understand the concepts. I usually have them present what they have learned to me. This time, I took the pleasure of recording their presentations.

Watch as my beautiful 9 and 6 year olds 'demystify' (LoL) the concepts of:


1. The Internet
2. Cloud Computing
3. Cyber Security and 
4. Cyber Bullying. 

Interestingly, their perspectives are slightly different on each subject. Let's watch!

This was recorded when she was 8 years old.
