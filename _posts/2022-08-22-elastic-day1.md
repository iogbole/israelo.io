As I sit here reflecting on the past five years, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions. On the one hand, I am filled with gratitude for the opportunities and experiences that I had at AppDynamics. On the other hand, I am excited for the new challenges and adventures that await me at Elastic.

I joined AppDynamics in 2017 from Microsoft. Little did I know at the time, the company would become a second home to me, and the people I worked with would become like family.

During my time at AppDynamics, I was fortunate enough to work on some truly groundbreaking projects. I was lucky enough to pioneer the work on auto-instrumenting <a href="https://www.appdynamics.com/blog/product/kubernetes-windows-container-monitoring/" target="_blank"> Windows container workloads on Kubernetes </a>,and I saw first-hand the impact it had on our customers and the sweet $3.5M in ARR for that fiscal year. I also had the chance to co-create the widely adopted <a hre="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ConfigMyApp" target="_blank"> AppDynamics  ConfigMyApp </a> tool - a Monitoring as code tool that let customers perform CRUD operations `as code` from their CI/CD pipeline -  on dashboards, health rules, business transactions configurations, etc. Wow, the joy of seeing my code run in production was epic. It didn't stop there, I led the intiative to create the first <a href="https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/appdynamics-ansible" target="_blank"> AppDynamics Ansible Collection </a> that manages all agent installation and <b>configurations as code</b>.

</p>

Then I changed roles from a hands-on Solutions Architect to an Engineering Product Manager. 

As a Product Manager, I brought my years of experience and customer empathy that I have developed from the field to the table as I helped build AppDynamics Cloud from scratch. I used my expertise to understand the needs of our customers and build a product that met those needs and exceeded their expectations. I was the Product Manager for Cloud Monitoring (AWS, Azure & GCP integration and correlation with K8s services), I also Product Managed Tagging and filtering, I blogged about it <a href="https://www.appdynamics.com/blog/cloud/getting-started-with-tags-in-appdynamics-cloud/" target="_blank">here</a> when it GA'ed. I'm proud of the work that I did to help take AppDynamics Cloud from zero to GA.

But as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. And after five amazing years, I have decided to move on to the next chapter of my career. I am excited to let you all know that I will be joining Elastic as a Principal Product Manager. 

For those who may not be familiar, Elastic is a leading provider of open-source search, analytics and observability solutions. The company's technology is used by some of the world's biggest brands to power their applications and make data more accessible and actionable. 

I will be working on integrating prodfiler.com - a whole-system, continuous profiling solution that is powered by eBPF, into the Elastic Observability suite, as well as find a product market fit for it. 

As I begin this new journey, I am filled with excitement and anticipation. I am looking forward to working with the talented team at Elastic and contributing to the development of their cutting-edge technology. I am also eager to learn from my new colleagues and continue to grow. 

In closing, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone at AppDynamics who helped me along the way. I will always cherish the memories and lessons that I gained during my time there. And to my new friends and colleagues at Elastic, I can't wait to see what the future holds for us. Here's to the next chapter!
